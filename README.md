The Toe Show is a open-source project anyone can fork remake and you might as well add GUI and change. Hope you guys enjoy it!
NOTE: This may not work on Windows, OS X, or Linux distros besides Twister OS & Raspbian, finally your system needs termnial, Bash/Shell, Python3, a text editior, and a file permission changer
For systems with a file permission changer like chmod +x & text editior like nano (if needs modification convert this to whatever you use. Example showed with nano & chmod +x)
chmod +x /directory/to/TheToeShow.py
nano /directory/to/TheToeshow
In nano do:
#!/bin/bash
python3 /home/pi/mu_code/Saves/TheToeShow.py
Save & exit (ctrl + X, Y, enter)
chmod +x /directory/to/TheShow
To run in terminal do cd /directory/to/file/that/TheToeShow/is/in, ./TheToeShow or click it in the file system.
NOTE: If you changed the name please make every TheToeShow to that name, and change the directory in the shell file.
